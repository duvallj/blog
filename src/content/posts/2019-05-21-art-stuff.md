So I like doing art. I'm not great at it, but apparently practice has elevated me to above-average now so that's fun.

One thing doing more art than usual has taught me is that good art, especially really good art is **super hard** and I totally respect anyone who can do that sort of thing.

I'll still definitely stick with programming and computer things (because I love it) but art I think is a good secondary thing to have going.

Will I post any art here? Probably, as soon as I figure out how to clean the metadata. Most stuff is either posted elsewhere already (under a moniker), or hand-drawn, and scanning is a pain. Anyways.
