Wow it's been a hot minute, huh? I did catch COVID again recently, but that was
only for a week, and really the reason I've not been posting is because I feel
broadcasting all my hot takes about how terrible Go is (from more experience
working on a Go service that I've had to redo many of the abstractions for)
isn't really productive. But you know what is productive? That's right, more CSS
bugs! And this time we have something special: a Safari bug! Sort of surprising
that I haven't shown off more of these, Safari is a pretty busted browser when
you get right down to it. There's another bug (related to this one) with an
inconsistent repro that I won't spoil just yet, so for now here's just a taste
for how weird it can get:

## Problem Statement

Consider the following problem: you have an arbitrarily-sized parent container,
and you want to make a child container with a fixed aspect ratio that fits flush
with the bounds of the parent[^1]. Seems simple enough, no?

## Solution 1: Simple Boundaries

<RawSnippet>
  <style>
    {`
  .container {
    background-color: #888;
  }
  .take1.container {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
  }
  .layer1 {
    background-color: var(--color-orange);
  }
  .take1 .layer1 {
    width: 100%;
    max-height: 100%;
    aspect-ratio: 1;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
  }
  .layer2 {
    background-color: var(--color-blue);
  }
  .take1 .layer2 {
    height: 100%;
    aspect-ratio: 1;
  }
`}
  </style>
  <div>
    <label for="w1">Width:</label>
    <input id="w1" type="range" min="120" max="600" value="200"></input>
    <label for="h1">Height:</label>
    <input id="h1" type="range" min="120" max="600" value="200"></input>
  </div>
  <div id="c1" class="container take1">
    <div class="layer1">
      <div class="layer2"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <script>{`
  const register = (inputId, divId, what) => {
    const input = document.querySelector(inputId);
    const div = document.querySelector(divId);
    const set = () => {
      div.style[what] = input.value + "px";
    }
    set();
    input.addEventListener("change", set);
  }
  register("#w1", "#c1", "width");
  register("#h1", "#c1", "height");
`}</script>
</RawSnippet>

Simple! Play around with the sliders to get a feel for how this works; there's
an blue box inside an orange box inside a gray parent container. How this works
is:

1. Layer 1 (orange) sets:
   1. `width: 100%` (be as wide as the parent)
   2. `aspect-ratio: 1` (make the implicit `height: auto` match the width)
   3. `max-height: 100%` (clip `height` to that of its parent)

That gives us an orange box that can be at most as tall as it is wide. Then:

2. Layer 2 (blue) sets:
   1. `height: 100%` (be as tall as the parent)
   1. `aspect-ratio: 1` (make the implicit `width: auto` match the height)

Because Layer 1 has `height <= width`, Layer 2 will be a perfect square, every time!

...except in Safari

## Safari's Problem

From what I understand, the problem happens at Layer 1. Instead of doing the
procedure outlined above, it instead seems to do something like this:

1. Layer 1 (orange) sets:
   1. `width: 100%` (be as wide as parent)
   1. `max-height: 100%` (clip `height: auto` to that of parent)
   1. `aspect-ratio: 1` (make height match width)

Step 2 doesn't do anything, because the default `height: auto` for a container
is `0`. It works if you swap around the width/height constraints between the two
layers, (because `width: auto` is `100%` so does get clipped properly), but this
feels like a hack, and besides there's a different solution that only uses one
layer.

## Solution 2: Good ol' `margin: auto`

<RawSnippet>
  <style>
    {`
  .take2.container {
    position: relative;
  }
  .take2 .layer1 {
    position: absolute;
    inset: 0;
    margin: auto;
    max-height: 100%;
    aspect-ratio: 1;
  }
`}
  </style>
  <div>
    <label for="w2">Width:</label>
    <input id="w2" type="range" min="120" max="600" value="200"></input>
    <label for="h2">Height:</label>
    <input id="h2" type="range" min="120" max="600" value="200"></input>
  </div>
  <div id="c2" class="container take2">
    <div class="layer1"></div>
  </div>
  <script>{`
  register("#w2", "#c2", "width");
  register("#h2", "#c2", "height");
`}</script>
</RawSnippet>

To me, it's a bit more magical how this works. This is what I _think_ is happening:

1. `position: absolute; inset: 0` inside a `position: relative` sets the child
   container's width and height to be that of the parent
   - but not the `width` and `height` properties directly! those are both still
     `auto` so it can participate in `aspect-ratio` resolution.
1. `aspect-ratio: 1` is applied, defaulting to setting height based on width
1. `max-height: 100%` is applied, clipping height
1. `aspect-ratio: 1` is applied again, this time setting width based on height,
   because width is still `auto`

This explanation checks out with all my previous ones: some sort of
"`auto`-resolution loop" happens, and we never saw it because earlier, one of
the `width`/`height` was non-`auto`. It also now makes sense why this works in
all browsers, because the order of `aspect-ratio`/`max-height` no longer
matters; `aspect-ratio` gets applied twice anyways.

What `margin: auto` does then, is center the div in both axes (and in Safari's
case, make it so the vertical margin can no longer be negative, because of
course Safari is still special). You can pin the container to a given side by
setting `margin-<side>: 0` afterwards.

Phew!! Box sizing is hard, man.

[^1]:
    There's an even harder variant of this problem that I had for
    [https://ro.am/howard/](https://ro.am/howard/): you have an arbitrary-sized
    parent container, and you want the child to overflow the parent in only one
    dimension with a fixed aspect ratio, but not just use [`object-fit:
cover`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) on an image
    because there are elements that need to be positioned relative to that image. I
    won't go into it here, you can read that page's source if you'd like tho :)
