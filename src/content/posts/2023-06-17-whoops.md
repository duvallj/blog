title: Whoops! Let's Get Back To Posting
description: I seem to have fallen behind on updating this blog. I don't excuse this, but do make promises about which posts I'll start backfilling.

I seem to have fallen behind on updating this blog! A lot of important life
events have occurred, which I probably should have blogged about at the time
when they were still fresh:

- My final semester at college
- Graduating from college
- Starting my job
- Some secret fourth thing

I'll backfill these posts in the coming days (weeks?) now that I have _even
better_ CI for this site. Riiiight after I change all the links from
sequentially numbered to date-and-title format, breaking all my SEO that was
never there in the first place :P
