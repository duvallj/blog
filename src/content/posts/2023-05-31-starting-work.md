Wow! It sure does feel weird to no longer be a college student any more.

After the usual craziness that is moving between apartments, I have settled in
Brooklyn, NY, the city right next to the Big Apple, for at least until the
lease expires.

Here, I'll be doing remote work for a remote work company,
[Roam](https://ro.am/about)!. I talked about them
[earlier](/posts/2022-12-12-first-job-secured.html), but today was my first day
so it's really official.

Team seems nice, work seems interesting, it's a pretty big codebase to learn
but I'll get right on it!
