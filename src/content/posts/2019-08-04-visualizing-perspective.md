So here's an excercise for you reader: picture a cube with a face flat towards you. Got it? Ok, now rotate it 30 degrees about the up-down axis (could be y or z depending on which you're more used to). Can you still clearly see the cube? Ok, now rotate that already rotated cube 15 degrees around the left-right axis. Can you still picture what the cube looks like?

See, here's the thing: I can't. Even after one rotation I have trouble focusing on exactly what the cube looks like in my mind's eye. Two rotations and it's really game over. Logically, I can understand there has to be a small kite, a medium kite, and a larger kite (from geometry, a kite is defined as a quadrilateral with two pairs of adjacent equal length sides), and I know where those shapes are, but for the life of me I can't visualize what they look like put together. It's like I hit a mental roadblock. It's annoying.

I've been thinking about that for a while, how my intuition about 3D space doesn't translate well into drawing it. Because I've been having trouble with it, I challenged myself to do an art piece with a cool perspective effect. It's hit-or-miss so far, but I'll keep at it.
