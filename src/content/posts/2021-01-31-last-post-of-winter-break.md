title: Last Post of Winter Break!

Wow I can't believe winter break is over! And yet at the same time, I can't
believe it was so long.

I've moved into my new university apartment faily close to campus and am writing
this post from my trusty laptop in the now-designated computer room. Due to the
de-densifying policy CMU has adopted, because this was a 3 person apartment that
2 people inhabited last semester, I am the only one in it this time around.

It's pretty nice, having the space for 3 people all to myself. I don't feel
cramped at all (unlike the last place, smaller than just this room and I had a
roommate!).

COVID is still putting a damper on meeting people, though. There's a mandatory
14-day "quarantine" where all classes will be online and extra-dorm activities
will be limited to exercise and grocery runs so long as you stay on the CMU
campus. Not even seeing anyone in-person outside of people on your floor, and
even then it has to be outdoors + with masks!

All told though, I'm very lucky given the circumstances. No sickness, good setup
(thanks Mom and Dad for helping me move in; you guys were awesome and I couldn't
have done it without you) and 100% prepared for classes.

See y'all in a couple weeks, by which time I may or may not be overwhelmed with
classes! We'll see.
