title: What I want posts to be
tags: daily thoughts

I let the morning slip away again, only this time because I slept in. Felt really good actually. I shouldn't be staying up this late because I want to get up early but yeah not having an alarm for once was nice (my phone died).

Wait a minute this isn't right. I don't want these posts to be just a collection of diary entries. I want them to be deeper thoughts than that. While keeping a daily journal is nice, it's be nicer to have a record of personal philosophy and stuff. The minutae can wait. Not even I will want to read that probably.

So, I apologize for the decline in quality, and will get some better stuff going soon. In the meantime, more sleep. No quote today.
