Hello 2023 I have some big news!! It took a bit longer than I thought but I finally finished the section of my website dedicated to photography.

## [Photography](/photography.html)

^^^ click that above link to go to it. I worked pretty hard on these photos during the semester and learned a _ton_ and I would be very honored if you would take a look at them :)

Oh but do be warned, there is approximately 0 optimization on these so each page is like 100MB or more, make sure you have a good internet connection before trying to load. This is also the part of the website I was complaining was hard in my previous post, turns out component-like things like "extra metadata per photo displayed in a common format" is harder than anticipated.

That's it for now, hopefully I have another post soon bye!!
