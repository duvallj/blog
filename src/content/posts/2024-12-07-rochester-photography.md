Figured I'd keep my photography-posting "streak" up, if you can call it that :P

This time I have pictures from a trip I took to Rochester, on my own time, to visit a friend who's at RIT there. Very fun, got a lot more "personal" pics than I did "artsy" ones. Still, got a few at least! Most happy with the last one, think I have a good thru-line for them as well. Check it out! [2024-10: Rochester](/photography/2024-10-rochester.html)
