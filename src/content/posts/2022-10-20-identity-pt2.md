title: Identity, Pt. 2
tags: daily thoughts
---

So maybe you've read my [other post about this from way
back](./2020-11-20-online-identity.html), or maybe not, and in either case I
think it deserves an update. TL;DR I've used an alternate name online for so
long that it feels like another persona.

### This is still going on huh

Yeah I don't know if I was or wasn't expecting it at the time but it's been
almost 2 years of this equilibrium, and I think at this point it's safe to say
it will probably continue indefinitely.

### Do u have any idea why

I have two main hypotheses for why this is happening:

- Internet Escapism
  - factors mentioned in the previous post, i.e. it's freeing to be less on-edge
    about how I'm presenting myself at all times
- I'm Built Different
  - this means whatever you think it means

### Are you going to connect these identities anytime soon?

Highly unlikely! In any case, through my involvement in
[AAC](https://www.cmuaac.com/projects), it's kinda already happened (because I
was careless)! It's still tricky enough to connect the two, and I'd like to keep
it that way for now.

## So what's the "update"?

The main thing that's changed is I'm much more invested in this alternate
identity. I have a separate website, more projects under the other GitHub
account, more social media profiles with that handle, more art, etc. Some people
I became friends with online refer to me by that name, in public, because that's
just who they know me as.

Another more recent change, and the thing which set off this post, is that I'm
really starting to explore what this means with other people, now that there
_are_ enough people who know both identities and therefore know my conundrum. If
you're one of those people, and you're reading this blog post, hi!

This is all still new for me, but in the meantime, I'll keep doing my same 'ol
same 'ol, being the best person I can be. Hope you're doing so too, see you next
time!
