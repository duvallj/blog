title: So It Was Actually Lyme Disease
tags: daily thoughts

So as I mentioned two posts ago, I had a pacemaker put in. Initially, the
doctors thought it was "Athletic Heart Syndrome" but that didn't really make
any sense since I don't work out that much. They put in a lab for
[Lyme Disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyme_disease) which came back
positive.

This makes a lot more sense, since I do regularly go for walks and runs in a
wooded area with known deer. I guess a tick bit me and I never noticed.

The strangest part is that I didn't get any of the other usual symptoms of
Lyme, just [Lyme Carditis](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/treatment/lymecarditis.html).

The other symptoms also have a much higher prevalence than Carditis, so the
doctors figured I was very unlucky to have it strike like this but very lucky
to have it be caught in time.

I'm taking IV antibiotics for the next weeks, right up until August 27th,
switching to oral antibiotics provided my condition improves. I have a
semi-permanent IV in my arm called a PICC line to allow me to take the
antibiotics at home, and after that I'll be fully cleared to go back to
exercise!

I can't wait to finally be better and really hope this works.
