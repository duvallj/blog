title: My Mile Time

I ran my first sub-6 mile today, a 5:59! I had no idea I could do this!

A bit of background: the captains of the Mr. Yuk Ultimate Frisbee team (which I
am a part of, and is still running practices despite all games being cancelled)
posted a challenge in the group Slack. If anyone could beat their 5:50 mile
time, the speedster would get a special prize. While I wasn't expecting to beat
their time, let alone come anywhere close, I thought it might be fun to try
because I haven't run a timed mile since Sophomore year of high school, when I
ran a 6:43.

One reason I may have improved: Since last summer, I have been running every
week. At first it was just simple Frisbee track practice drills to keep my
stamina from last year, then it was training with my brother and his actual
track coach to improve speed and sprinting form, and now for the entire spring
semester I have been working on distance runs, slowly pushing from 4 to 5 to
now almost 6 miles as my last run.

And this is all on top of other weight training I do. I am probably at my
current peak fitness, even counting Junior year of high school when I was doing
wrestling practice 6 days a week or Freshman Spring of college when I could
(just barely) play 6 frisbee games in 2 days.

This feels good. So good, in fact, that I remembered my blog and also that I
forgot to post last weekend. Oh well, I didn't have much to write about
anyways except for more cool CV projects.
