I went to an Ultimate Frisbee tournament today. Played in, specifically. For those unfamiliar with the game, Ultimate Frisbee is a non-contact sport played with the classic Frisbee where teams of 7 players attempt to catch the Frisbee in the opponent's end zone while blocking the opponent from doing the same to them.

It's a good sport, and I had a lot of fun today even though now I'm exhausted. I like Frisbee because it's something active to do with friends. Really any sport could be like that but the culture around UF is very welcoming compared to other, more competitive sports.

I guess tomorrow's post will be about how we did in the tournament, we play 3 more games tomorrow too to determine our final placing.
