Wow, a lot sure has happened since I went to college and stopped updating this blog! Going to college meant I couldn't leave my old laptop plugged in and constantly hosting on a free domain like before (sad), but now I re-discovered that my high school has free hosting (yay)! So I exported my blog here, where it will stay until I get kicked off and have to pay for hosting somewhere else. Thank goodness Wordpress is a stable piece of software.

Hopefully in the coming few days I remember to post more frequently again. I have a couple cool projects to show since last year ;) Stay fresh, anyone reading this!
