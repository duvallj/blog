You thought I was done with these daily blog updates? HA, think again! I have so much more to complain about to no one in particular but am uncomfortable saying aloud because I have self-esteem issues and think my friends will think less of me if I bother them with inane problems!

Anyways, why the heck does it take so long to 3D print stuff? [Cura](https://www.lulzbot.com/cura) says it'll take 20 hours for this cool-looking pencil holder thing to get made. I don't know if I can wait that long, but I already started the build, so we'll see. Maybe tomorrow there'll be a photo?
