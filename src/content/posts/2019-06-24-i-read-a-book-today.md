I read a book today. Started reading, to be precise. I should read more often; it was very enjoyable. First, though, I should probably find more active things to do so I'm not feeling bored and lethargic enough to start reading randomly. Or maybe that's a bad way to think: reading is actually really good apparently, crucial even to a well-balanced life. So maybe I'll do it more often now. Cool.
