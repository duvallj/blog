title: Haskell Packages are Pretty Ok and Other Ramblings

After writing the code for [my previous blog
post](./2020-08-19-hacking-on-hakyll.html), today I put it into a separate
Haskell package so my code doesn't smell too bad anymore.

I also fixed a small CSS error that caused the font size on mobile to be waay
too big. Forgot the `.` in `1.8rem` \*facepalm\*.

Oh yeah I also installed a LaTeX package so now I can do cool stuff like

$$f(x) = \sqrt{1-x^2}$$

while writing these posts. Which will hopefully be useful in the future as I
talk about math at school more although I don't know how much I'll be able to
post then as I have both a heavy course load and two small part-time jobs that
add up to a fairly substantial part-time job.

Also you might be thinking, "Jack you have only posted about this darn blog for
the last `n` days, isn't it time to write about something else??" To which I
say, yes, you are absolutely correct, it's just that I usually write these posts
right after working on the code for the site generator so that's usually what
I'm thinking about at the time lol. We'll see what happens after I stop work on
the backend and actually get to a "post grind" lol
