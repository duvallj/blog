So this will be my last post for a while. I'm going on vacation to Michigan with my family so I not get to use my phone before bed anymore. Really not much at all for that matter, because I will be prioritizing time with extended family instead.

Going up to the lake in Michigan has been a family tradition for who knows how long, at least since Dad was a baby even. This year we'll me making a bit of a detour first in New York to attend my maternal grandfather's funeral, which is tough, no one is prepared to deal with that kind of emotion with the loss of a family member. It'll be strange to be all mournful and then cheery as we drive to the lake the next day but I digress.

Expect another post detailing my thoughts on my vacation after I get back. I hope the habits I worked so hard to build this summer, like Duolingo practice in the morning, Art practice in the evening, and blogging in the late evening aren't disrupted by this week of other stuff. Anyways, see ya later!
