## What am I going to do with myself?

<hr/>

Finally, the Winter semester has ended, and I finally have time to do non-school
activities!

I have a couple things planned:

- Work on contributing the FCN model for <https://github.com/onnx/models>.
  Currently, I am installing ONNX and ONNXRuntime which has proved a bit harder
  than `pip install onnx onnxruntime` for various reasons, unfortunately.
- Do some art! Daily practice is the plan. I found some warmup routines to do,
  which includes a lot more gesture drawings than I was comfortable with but I
  think it has already made me a bit better
  - Part of this will be to make some personal art, and part will also be to
    make some art for AAC's Secret Santa art exchange.
- Walk my dogs
- Practice Skullgirls?
- Other AI reading/programming stuff as it comes up

### Wait I don't see any Aerospace on that list...

Yeah, and not just because I forgot to mention it. As a consequence for
accepting another internship for the upcoming summer, I am no longer allowed to
work for Aerospace during the school year. This kinda sucks, because I was
having a great time there getting to do cool AI research. I hope the next
internship (which I will elaborate on more in a later post) will be as good.

I mostly accepted the other offer because I wanted to explore more. The
obscene amounts of money had little to do with it (although that is a nice
perk). I am under a confidentiality agreement on the exact amount, but it
definitely exceeded by expectation for intern pay, even for a California-based
company.

Other notable updates:

- Might get my first B in college due to getting consistent B's on 21-355 exams.
  Although maybe not? Depends on whether the exams are out of 115 or 100 points.
- I have been compiling `pandoc` on the machine hosting this blog for almost 2
  full days now. It is still not done and probably won't be for another 2 days
  at this rate. Fun!
- Friends have organized a modded Minecraft server known as [JEFFREY](https://gitlab.com/1F335/modpackman/-/tree/JEFFREY-3),
  which is pretty fun even though I am not very good at Minecraft.
