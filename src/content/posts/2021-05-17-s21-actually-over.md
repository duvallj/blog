Can't believe the day has finally come!

- All my finals and final projects are turned in
- I'm moved out of my apartment and am back in my parents' house with my family.
- Just chilling before starting my remote internship on the 24th

It's very nice to not have any more deadlines, although it's sort of been like
that ever since last Monday (with the exception of my 15-210 final on that day
and my Japanese final paper due Friday), so I'm already in that Summer groove.
I will definitely hang out with friends more, or at least try to, now that we
are all relatively free of deadline shackles. Here's to a good Summer '21!
