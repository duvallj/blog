I try to avoid it, mostly. I'm pretty sure only 3-4 photos of me exist publicly online. I've also tried to separate my "professional" accounts from my "personal" accounts, although with enough digging (no I'm not going to tell you where) it's possible to link the two realms.

This blog is actually on the "professional" side. Kind of strange to think about, I don't do this kind of random thoughts thing anywhere else, even in private chat servers (except occasionally in DMs to friends). It's kind of a load off to be able to just say stuff, even if it is to the loneliness of a self-hosted blog on the public internet.
