What I did today, in bullet point form:

- Woke up late
- Made oatmeal
- Watched YouTube while eating said oatmeal
- Played video games
- Went over to a friend's house for their graduation party. It was very fun, got to see old friends and make new ones. All in all a great experience with lots of physical activity, card games, and the staple of any teenage party: video games. Lunch and dinner were had there, tacos.
- Did some art. Worked way too long on it for something I'm not terribly proud of but hey I practiced.

Result: I wish I could've gotten up earlier but that was another great summer day. Won't have too many of these left nope. Gotta get together with friends soon.
