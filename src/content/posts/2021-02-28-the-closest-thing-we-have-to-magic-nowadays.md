title: The Closest Thing We Have to Magic Nowadays

Alright, so this is a bit silly, but it's one of those things I think about
often enough that I'm writing about here lol.

## Background

I'm fascinated by magic systems that seem to have some sort of underlying
ruleset to them. I've been heavily influenced by magitech-like series such as
[A Certain Scientific
Railgun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Certain_Scientific_Railgun),
[Ender's Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game), and [The SCP wiki
](http://www.scpwiki.com/) (especially works by [`djkaktus`
](http://www.scpwiki.com/djkaktus)), as well as more fantasy-esque works like
[Quiet & Antagonism](https://quietandantagonism.com/) (this one is very obscure but **I
love it so much** it's definitely worth a read) and [Bone
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_%28comics%29).

OK so maybe not all of these are all quite rule-based as I would like for a
good example, but the point is that when I think of "magic," I don't
immediately default to thinking about western wizard-style magic like
[DnD](https://dnd.wizards.com/),
[LotR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings),
[Harry Potter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter), or magic from
[insert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KonoSuba)
[generic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_Time_I_Got_Reincarnated_as_a_Slime)
[isekai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is_It_Wrong_to_Try_to_Pick_Up_Girls_in_a_Dungeon%3F)
[fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re:Zero_%E2%88%92_Starting_Life_in_Another_World)
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlord_%28novel_series%29), or maybe a
[shonen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_%C3%97_Hunter)
[fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto)'s magic system.

Narratively, a rule system sets up some extra hurdles the protagonists must
work around, showing their perseverance, or some neat things they can exploit
in unexpected ways, showing their cleverness. A good rule system allows for
endless possibilities, even outside of what's shown in the story. I like this
because it gets me thinking, "how would _I_ go about figuring that out?" which
is very engaging.

## What this has to do with real life

There are plenty of [memes](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/388924578812002336/815641900374556752/EvQkCeDXUAcvfuJ.png)
about it, but just think: electronics _are_ basically magic. I'm taking an
electronics class right now ([18-310, Fundamentals of Semiconductor Devices](https://courses.ece.cmu.edu/18310)),
and a lot of the stuff we are learning just blows my mind how scientists were
able to figure out in the first place. And yet, here we are: we have a model
for exactly how little invisible """electrons""" move around inside materials
carrying some intrinsic, quantized """charge""" and if you set things up just
right we can, to borrow from the overly simple phrasing in the meme, "make sand
think." But this isn't magic, it's real! For everything we learn in this
course, we can set up an experiment to test it! People already have!

To me, that's the most awesome part; this world _does_ have a "magic system"
and I'm learning it right now. Sure it isn't, "if I think hard enough, I can
shoot a fireball out of my fingers," but that'd be too easy and those are the
lazy systems I hate anyways. You need to know a lot of math and physics and
chemistry to do anything here, but that's OK. All I can say is that I'm
thankful to be around when so much has been figured out already, and we have
the tools to figure so much more out too.

## Aside

I would like to see more math used in magic systems. Math is so important in
real science, after all. This has motivated me to start designing my own
world/magic system, the both of which are still woefully incomplete. I hope to
one day write a story using it, but who knows if that day will ever come lol.
