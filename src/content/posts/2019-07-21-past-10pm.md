After I'm supposed to go to sleep, but am still awake, I turn into a different person.
I'm more outgoing. I care lesss about long-term repercussions. I slur my words more.
I'm crazy and conscious of it yet I love it and can't stop. No, I'm not implying
that I drink alcohol (hate the stuff) or do any other sort of drug at night.
No, the nightÂ *is* my drug.

So anyways that's how I just confessed I was horny while writing this post. Blehck.
