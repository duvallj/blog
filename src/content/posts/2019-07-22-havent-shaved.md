title: Haven't shaved

...my stubble for like 3 days now. Man do I look scraggly. It's also itchy. I don't know how people with beards do it.

Honestly, shaving every morning isn't even that hard. It takes 2 min max and gives good results for the effort put in. Maybe not the best results, because a 5'oclock shadow is a real thing (hair grows back!) but good enough.

I don't know where I'm going with this, other than having a full, professional-looking beard is probably even more work to maintain than a clean shave. I wouldn't know. I don't plan on findings out either, definitely shavings tomorrow morning.
