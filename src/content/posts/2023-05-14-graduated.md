A **_ton_** of extended relatives came out to see me graduate, which was super
kind of them and honestly pretty fun to hang out with.

I can't believe I'm finally done with it! I had some good times, some bad
times, made a lot of friends, took a lot of classes, and the best part is, I
don't think I have regrets really. I made the most out of what I had, which was
a lot, and had fun while doing it.

So long CMU, thanks for the memories!
