Wow I've been slacking on this one!! I have like 2? other albums I need to curate & get up here as well. Hoping to get those out of the way so I can focus all my photography attention on my New York City project (sitll very WIP). Then again I have so many other plates to juggle that idk if I'll get a proper "2024 NYC" out by the end of this year...

Oh well! At least we have [2024-09: Montreal](/photography/2024-09-montreal.html) to look at in the meantime :) I'm pretty happy with these, had to cut quite a lot of cruft to get them tho. Def leaning into being a Digital Photographer with that approach... good thing I love digital photography!!
