Like look at this: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value#Calculation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value#Calculation)

Literally just "plug your data into a formula and get out a p" how crazy is that? Really I can only make sense of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_exact_test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_exact_test) but even that's a little tough to understand. Maybe I just need to study statistics more...
