At 4:32PM today, it was 3/14 15:92, which is approximately $$\pi$$. Very neat.

Don't have too much to talk about so have a grab-bag of things which I think
are pretty cool:

## My Friend's Blog

Just getting started, but has a really good first post! <https://williamoconnell.me/blog/post/magic-pirate/>

## Someone Else's Blog

[jez.io](https://jez.io/thoughts/on-leaving-facebook/) has some cool posts too.
I forget how exactly I came across this blog, but it's pretty good too.

## A CV Project I've Done

This was for class, doing some (non real-time) AR composition:

<div>
<figure><video controls src="/uploads/ar-thingy.mp4" style="width: 100%"></video></figure>
The Kung-Fu Panda trailer is composited onto a textbook cover
</div>
Yes it is very shaky, no I'm not entirely sure why (probably because the
homography computation was unstable, wasn't sure how to fix before the
deadline).
