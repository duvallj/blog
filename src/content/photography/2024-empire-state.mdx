When I visited [London](/photography/2024-06-london.html), I had
the chance to go to the Tate Modern. Really cool museum, very glad I went.
Anyways, while I was there, and already thinking about photography lots, I
stumbled across an exhibit about American photographer Joel Meyerowitz.

It was a cool exhibit! Big inspiration while I was there, and I think also
in Dylan Vitone's class. One small series in particular caught my eye:

<Photograph {...frontmatter.images[0].images[0]} />

Hey I know that place! I live there!! Energized on the ride home, I traced
back the exact locations of each of the shots and made plans to take photos
in each location. For completeness' sake, here are those locations, read
right-to-left:

1. 7th Ave, W 44th, from inside the building
2. Broadway, W 29th
3. 9th Ave, W 34th
4. 11th Ave, W 34th

I was planning on scoping out the locations with my iPhone, and then taking
"finals" with my Canon once I nailed down the exact angles and lighting I
would need to replicate these photos _exactly_. Unfortunately, life
gets in the way, and I got sick with Covid before that could happen, and
then I dropped the project :(

Still, I do have _some_ iPhone images! I couldn't get (1) because it's
tricky to figure out how to get inside a locked building (do I email the property
managers? and tell them what story??). I hope you find these cool anyways, because
despite everything, I still do :)
