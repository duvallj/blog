There was a bit more of a break between this and the last trip, during which I may have focused on various non-photography things. I had tried to go out with my DSLR in NYC (at this rate I'll get that album out next year lol), but sort of grew weary of the standard city shots. To be frank, I took a lot of city shots on this expedition, and Montreal is a beautiful & photogenic city. But only by getting a little experimental with the crops could I feel like I got something worth sharing.

Anyways, enough prelude, here's the photos. I had to modify my blog's code to properly handle images this tall/wide lol

Yep, another all-iPhone 11 Pro Max one... And so is the next one probably... I swear I'm going to upgrade cameras eventually, it's simply too darn easy to point-n-shoot with this thing tho!!
