      caption: 'Honestly, it''s probably a good thing the sous vide idea didn''t end up working out; we would have been stuck with the fact that, once out of the water, the laptop cools quite quickly, and there''s only a limited time window to slide the knife thru the adhesive before it "hardens" into an impossibly sticky mess again. And once open, it''s much harder to sous vide, so yeah we found a better solution: microwavable heat packs that we could lay on just the next area to slice, with increasing numbers of cards pulled from our wallets prying the already-sliced parts open.',

This photo was taken a bit of the way through that process, after removing some of the screws, and <i>yet more</i> adhesive that was hiding <i>yet more</i> screws (required btw).

I visited CMU for [Spring Carnival](https://www.cmu.edu/engage/alumni/events/campus/spring-carnival/index.html)! I had a blast doing the classic Carnival activities like Booth & Buggy, but really I had the most fun when hanging out with friends. These first set of photos are from when I went with some friends to the nearby [Phipps Conservatory](https://www.phipps.conservatory.org/):

<br />

The rest of these images are from a party where I helped [Holly](https://holly-liu.webflow.io/holly) tear apart her [Surface Book 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_Book_2), a very challenging task as you soon shall see. They were taken with a very bad digital camera ([Canon PowerShot SX230 HS](https://global.canon/en/c-museum/product/dcc601.html)) that was lying around, mostly because I thought it would be fun and indeed it was quite the fun challenge to work with it to get usable pictures. I had a blast that night; catching up with old friends, tearing apart a laptop, and photography, what more could I ask for?? I hope the joy I had comes across in these photos:
