I got out for quite a few shoots on this one, mostly while I was going for runs, having a fairly good idea of what I wanted to do, but in the end it still didn't quite come out exactly the way I was envisioning... Because this was meant to be put to music, I ended up spending a lot more time putting the video together rather than editing the photos, so all these images are as the iPhone 11 Pro Max processes them as opposed to raws that I edited in Photoshop.

The song I chose was [Lucian - Cross the Bridge ft. Annamarie Rosanio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOXn2qtGa4Q), hence all the bridges :P

Seemed to be received OK. This actually isn't the full set of images, just the best few I liked, and I don't plan on uploading the video because it's not actually that good...

Still, I guess I really proved you _can_ do a photography assignment with just an iPhone lol
