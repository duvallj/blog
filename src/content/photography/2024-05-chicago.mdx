Since taking Dylan Vitone's class in college, I've always been thinking about photography. The introductory class didn't instantly make be a better photographer, but it did give me the bare basics of photography fundamentals and a taste for what a good photographer's eye can produce.

However, I hadn't really gone out anywhere with a specific photography goal in mind, often only taking one or two photos at a time, which isn't really enough to build a compilation off of. What changed this time around is that:

1. I had seen a really good photography exhibit, [An-My Lê: Between Two Rivers/Giữa hai giòng sông/Entre deux rivières](https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/5467) somewhat recently, quite a few times actually, and was feeling an urge to take more photos.
2. Chicago is a beautiful city, so I was feeling extra inspired.
3. I had lots of downtime before the work event happening later that day, so I had the opportunity to act on my inspiration.

With all that in mind, please enjoy the images I've chosen present for my "return" to photography as it were, all shot on iPhone 11 Pro Max with only the default post-processing.

Shooting only on iPhone didn't feel like a restriction this time. If anything, the point-and-shoot nature was really freeing this time around, getting back into the swing of things. Doesn't make great photos when blown up to very high resolution, but they look fantastic on a monitor, which is how most photos are viewed I think.

I continue the trend of iPhone shooting during my next trip, to [London](/photography/2024-06-london.html).
