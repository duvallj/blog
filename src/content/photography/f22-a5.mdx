My idea for this assignment was "home" which meant I basically had just a few chances to do shoots while I was at my parent's house over Thanksgiving break. I hadn't been back for a while at this point and was feeling very nostalgic to be there and I hope that shows through in these images :)

Despite having to do part of this on flights, I actually think this is some of my better work. I paid attention to composition and used it to tell a story and while I did go a little overboard on the photoshop maybe I think the results look p good.

Never actually got any feedback on this one since I turned it in a day late oops (I was out interviewing for a job)
