For a long time, I've wanted to go to Japan. I'm a big fan of manga (did you know that Viz publishes Shonen Jump Weekly in English every week? I read the whole thing!) & anime, their aesthetic & their food, just yeah seemed like a cool place. One day, I made an offhand comment about it to my roommate, and we somehow ended up planning a whole 2-week thing, centered around hiking the [Kumano Kodo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumano_Kod%C5%8D), with plenty of time in Tokyo too. And then we made it happen!

Most of the trip photos I took were quite tourist-y, but I still had a good selection to choose from when compiling these. Hope you enjoy!

In short, I had a blast on this trip, and can't wait to go back in the future. We saw so many things, but didn't see nearly everything, and plus, that food... I gotta eat more sushi...
