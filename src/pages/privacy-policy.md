description: What this site does with your data (spoiler, pretty much nothing)

## Who we are

Just me, Jack Duvall. My website address is
[https://duvallj.pw](https://duvallj.pw). But you already know that, since
you're here!

## Analytics

### What personal data we collect and why we collect it

I don't collect any data about who's visiting my site; all the logging in AWS
S3 and CloudFront and Route 53 are turned off.

### Who we share your data with

No one, because even if I did collect data (which I don't) I don't think that's
a good thing to monetise.

## Additional Information

### Data Breach Policy

This is a static site. I don't think there's any way for your data to be
breached unless AWS gets hacked somehow?

### Can I log in with Facebook?

No

### Do you have Zero-Knowledge compliance?

I don't know anything about that and also when did this turn into a FAQ?

### Can I pet dogs on this site?

[_(crying)_ This FAQ is over!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1671210/DELTARUNE/)
