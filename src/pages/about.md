description: About me, Jack Duvall, just in general

Hi, I'm currently a Software Engineer at [Roam](https://ro.am/about). I'll put
some of my projects and random thoughts on here.

I think Computer Science, Machine Learning (especially applied to Computer
Vision), and Art are all cool.

You can usually find me at my computer.
