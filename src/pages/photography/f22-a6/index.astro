    I thought I would need to dig more heavily from past assignments for this
    one. As it turns out, I didn't actually like as many of my old photos
    anymore and was able to shoot some pretty good new ones!
  </p>
  <p>
    This can <em>sort of</em> be viewed as a compilation of everything I learned
    this semester, story is much less coherent than other works however and are sort
    of more just based on vibes :) anyways hope you enjoy!!

    And with that, so concludes all the photos I shot for my very first
    photography class. It was a ton of fun, Dylan Vitone is a great professor
    and human being, also shoutouts to all my classmates for being great
    inspirations through y'alls work and conversations! I'll never forget this
    class and what I learned there.
