    I sort of ended up doing this for my second assignment too. I tried to
    replicate some stuff I liked best I could, but a few of these were rushed so
    I'm not terribly happy with how it turned out, oh well.

    Classmates called this one a little somber yet hopeful, that is sort of what
    I was going for so overall not too bad I think.
