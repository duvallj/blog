    High off my success in Chicago, I resolved to continue taking photos during
    my big trip to London. I had a blast there, and honestly a majority of my
    free time was spent just wandering around the waterfront, Central London, or
    even just right by my hotel, admiring all the cool architecture. Really
    great city, can't wait to go back sometime!

  <p>
    In this excursion, I took over twice as many photos as I did in Chicago, yet
    ended up with less I was actually proud of. I think this is due to a couple
    things:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Overcast lighting makes things look flat, which is not what I was going
      for.
    </li>
    <li>
      Really starting to feel the limitations of the iPhone camera platform; I
      was itching to do something "more", but time crunch and hardware
      limitations got in my way.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Overall, still pretty happy with the ones that did turn out well, but my
    next project will be on a "real" camera for sure lol.
