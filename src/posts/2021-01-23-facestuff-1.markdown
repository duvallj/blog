title: Live2D Demo Application Expanded

The slow burn project I mentioned
[earlier](./2021-01-08-live2d-license-close-reading.html) has concluded for now
at least. Not for lack of progress, but actually because I completed a major
milestone in actually getting it to work!

### What does it do?

Currently, [the application](https://github.com/duvallj/facestuff):

- Renders a sample Live2D model at 60fps
- Takes an image from the webcam and detects a face in it at 4fps
- Composites the two images together

This required the intersection of many different graphics technologies which I'm
not sure were all made to go together:

- [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) creates the window and initializes an [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) context (together with [GLEW](https://www.opengl.org/sdk/libs/GLEW/) to help with the dynamic loading that OpenGL requires)
- [Live2D Cubism Native Framework](https://github.com/Live2D/CubismNativeFramework) loads the proprietary model format and renders it (when in the OpenGL context).
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) handles opening the webcam and detecting a face in it
- [A Custom GUI Library](https://github.com/duvallj/ACGL) built on top of SDL spawns the two threads to do Live2D rendering and OpenCV maths at the same time, as well as controlling the layout of the scene.
- And finally, raw OpenGL shaders that I had to [find a good tutorial for](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/beginners-tutorials/tutorial-5-a-textured-cube/) to render the OpenCV data

In the end, I got a pretty good result:

The background of the frame is the screen this is displayed on, causing it to recurse for a few iterations." title="Pretty trippy, huh?" />

I've put the project on hold for now, partly because I've accomplished
a lot of what I wanted to do (get all these libraries working with one another
at all), but mostly because School is coming up soon! I leave the 29th and start
February 1st which is very close. Also I went skiing in the meantime which was
very fun and put a damper in doing many things code-related during it. Anyways,
see you next time!
