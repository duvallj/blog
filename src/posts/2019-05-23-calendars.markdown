I don't know why, but I haven't gotten into any habit of using them. I know they're useful, but I don't check or put any dates on them.

Come to think of it, that's probably a self-perpetuating cycle. Huh.

I'm usually fine with keeping all the important dates in my head. That's worked out fine for quizzes and tests. Not so much for Senior Shirt Day (which was today) or other long-term planning things like internships. The former example is why I bring this up; missing the group photo, while kind of just novelty, sort of stings.
