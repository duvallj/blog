The game: only reveal my thoughts online, and nothing physical. If close friends find out about this blog they will know me even better because I usually don't share what I think.

Yay I was able to practice art today, along with everything else (including programming!), but at the cost of sleep. Thank you, friend who did art with me.

Wait a minute I have to get up early tomorrow. How am I going to fit it my morningÂ [Duolingo](https://duolingo.com) practice? Going to friend's house in the afternoon, might be too late. We'll see.

Oh yes the 3D printed thing. Good news: it finished! Bad news: I forgot to take a picture. Tomorrow!
