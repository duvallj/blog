Heyyy, I'm finally back from vacation! Yes, I had a great time, and yes, I saw lots of family and did the classic American things like play cards and eat barbecue and shoot fireworks and water slalom ski and yeah it was pretty awesome I'll tell you what. I'll elaborate more on some aspects later (little cousins + wakeboarding probably).

Looking back at my older posts... yeah uh I was really not kidding about that art thing. I still am not kidding and want to practice again today even though I've sat 9 hours in the car and am feeling blergh. Don't have too many deep thoughts right now since my brain is friend from a [Legend of Korra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Korra) marathon in the car, so yeah I'ma just end this post here. See y'all bots tomorrow!
