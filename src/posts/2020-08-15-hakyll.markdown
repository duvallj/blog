Hi! This site looks a little different how. Just for fun, I'd thought I'd move
away from Wordpress (MySQL is very slow and PHP is not a great language and also
Wordpress itself has a bunch of vulnerabilities) and towards a static site.

As you may have guessed from the title of this post, I'm using a system called
[Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll) to make it. Hakyll is written in Haskell
which is one of the worst language's I've had the pleasure of working with. It
was a challenge to get the [tags section](/tags.html) customizable, among many
other issues I had with learning Haskell in general.

Also, I'm still doing art! I have improved a lot but still not enough to the
point where I'd feel comfortable cross-posting to something else here. Maybe
one day I'll muster up the courage to put some of my figure drawings here.

Oh yeah also Coronavirus, crazy right? Don't worry I'll have a post about that soon.
