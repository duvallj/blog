Wow the blog sure looks snazzy now! I ripped the twenty-fifteen theme from
Wordpress and applied it to my new Hakyll blog and tweaked it a little and
now it looks pretty nice if I do say so myself. I'm sure I'll find more ways to
tweak it, but for today I am done.

Also I've been doing art more so maybe I'll have a piece to post here one day?
Who knows. anyways I need to find a place to host this soon so ppl can actually
see the improvements and content instead of just me. Although I am running this
blog just for me anyways. idk we'll see.
