Stuff I did get around to after school today:

- Walking my dogs
- Making dinner
- Cleaning the kitchen
- Exercise
- College finances (a little bit, but it helps)
- Color coding my [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/) calendars
- Watching art videos

Stuff I did not get around to after school:

- Practicing Super Smash Bros. (did a lot of that during school, shouldn't matter)
- Practicing what I learned in the art videos

I should be better about this...but I don't want to sacrifice sleep. This post is usually the last thing I do before I go to bed (I know I know, unnatural light is bad, too bad).

Also, update on 3D print thing: what was supposed to be a 15hr print turned into a 30hr one (I knew I should've turned off infill), so it's still going. I promise tomorrow.
