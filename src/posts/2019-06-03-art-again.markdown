Haha yes [Clip Studio Paint](https://www.clipstudio.net/en) is truly a magical piece of Japanese software. All the brush and texture presets are very quality and emulate a lot of the classic manga stuff you see a lot.

Coming from [Krita](https://krita.org/en/), there's a palpable increase in professionality and polishedness of the whole system, even if the UI style isn't exactly modern. I still need to get used to the key bonds but fortunately a lot carries over.

I know using a new art program won't automatically improve my drawing skills, but at least now I don't think I'll have to try as hard to get certain things done. Plus I like the presets more. Too bad it's paid, but I'm definitely willing to shell out a cool $50 for a professional program with (hopefully) lifetime updates.

Also, about the 3D thing I said I was going to show? Yeah uh the filament broke in the middle of the night around 1/3rd the way through the build, had to restart :(. Tomorrow then.
