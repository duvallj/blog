Recently, I had the idea to look through some old AP Literature writing I did.
Not to brag too much but uh, it's pretty good?? I'm including an essay that
I'm really proud of here:

## Creative Writing: Nonfiction (Reworked)

30 May 2019

As I transition from high school to college, I've done some thinking about how
I best learn. After all, so I'm told, college is where students are challenged
to pace themselves, the bulk of the work being done outside the classroom. This
in and of itself doesn't bother me; I can time-manage and slog through mountains
of homework with the best of 'em. No, what bothered me is this: if I don't know
my own strengths, then I can't play to them to save time or shore up my own
weaknesses.

After some experimentation, I could conclusively point out things that are not
my strengths. I'm impatient; I'm set in my ways; I can't focus on future plans;
I have limited people skills; I underestimate the value of others; I can't think
fast, or strategically; I can't visualize shapes clearly; I don't have an ear
for music. I was told I think too poorly of myself, that I can improve on any of
these things with time, that professionals have dedicated years of their life
towards learning something I can't possibly hope to understand in one week. I
had a hard time swallowing this. It seemed like shifting the blame, which is
pretty shifty if you ask me.

As an example, the other day, I tried to play the piano. _It's just notes on a
page, those are easy to read,_ I thought. Individually, yes, after a good ten
seconds of counting up or down from middle C. Then came the unanticipated
challenge of getting my fingers to press the right notes without looking. Then
came stringing all that together at a reasonable pace. I pressed through for a
bit longer, learning to play a few bars, but then I got discouraged by lack of
immediate progress. It was just another frustrating riff on other unfamiliar
subjects I'd tried before, like art, Tetris, and basketball.

So, what was I comfortable with, able to do quickly and without a second
thought? Programming comes to mind. What's so special that makes me suited for
it? Broad information synthesis? A keen eye for details? A knack for language
of any sort? Raw experience curated by years of specialization? If it's the last
of the bunch, I feel cheated. I want to get good at a lot of things, and yet the
only path towards that goal is time? What a ripoff. Time is precious. It doesn't
seem physically possible, let alone desirable, to spend every waking hour
working towards one goal after another.

As I thought these things, I confided in a friend. He told me this: your
perspective is totally off. First, you need to stop comparing yourself to
others; it's unhealthy. Then, you need to slap yourself in the face, tell
yourself you _are_ good enough, and stick to whatever constructive practice
regimen is necessary. You will get better. You might not ever reach your goal,
but you will get better, which is what matters. I was shook, for lack of a
better word. Logically speaking, it makes sense that good artists, musicians,
public speakers, and sports players spend years perfecting their craft, years
which I don't have under my belt. And yet some notion possessed me to think I
could get the same results, only better and more quickly, simply because I could
understand _what_ they were doing, not ever really _how_.

Being relieved of that thought train was sobering. It did nothing to lessen the
frustration I felt when I couldn't draw a precise curved line, couldn't beat my
friend at Tetris, or couldn't put that darn large orange ball in the darn red
hoop. Instead of submitting, though, I now know what to do: keep going. I'm
still at a loss for how to play to my strengths. But by some miracle of hard
work I made it through high school, and gosh darn it, I'll work my butt off to
keep improving through college and life as well. In my opinion, that's what
being human is all about.

In the almost 2 years since I wrote this, I've kept the same perspective. And
wouldn't you know it, _I've gotten a lot better at things_. My art is leagues
above where is was before (and I still have leagues to go). I didn't practice
Tetris or basketball, but I did practice some [fighting
games](./2020-08-22-skullgirls.html),
and now I can beat everyone I know (not always easily, and none specialize in
fighting games either and I still get destroyed online). I've also been working
out (weight training + some running) and have seen steady improvement there
too.

Having this mindset and being able to see the results has been very gratifying.
It's such a privilege to know that yes, if I put in the work, I really can do
anything. I'm also fortunate to be in an environment where it's even possible
to put in so much work. Thanks to the support of my family and friends, I have
achieved all my goals in school and mini-goals in hobbies. I look forward to
doing even more!
