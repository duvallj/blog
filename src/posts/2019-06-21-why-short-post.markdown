Short post today because I stayed up too late programming. It was very fun but took longer than I thought to make a python script that fetched the currently playing song from Spotify. Also bummed there weren't any working existing solutions. So yeah at least now I have something going, and ready to be used on my next art stream. I should've actually practiced art today tho. Oh well.
